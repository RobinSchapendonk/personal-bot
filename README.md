# My personal bot

My personal bot which I use in every server I own.

## Installation

This is NOT made to be run by yourself, as it includes some private things for Pok√©Hunt. If you remove those part it will probably just be fine.

## Usage

#### With docker
Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
Fill in the `.env.example` and run `npm start` or `npm run start-docker.

#### Without docker
Fill in the `.env.example` and run `npm run start-normal`.
