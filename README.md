# My personal bot

This is my personal bot it includes my site, my modmail, anti-raid, moderation and music. You can self host it, but not invite mine (due to the modmail going to me then).
ModMail works in all servers, and you can reply / manage using http://localhost:3000/mail.

Note: this includes my personal website.
